        <p>Hi Deepak,</p>
        <p>Congratulations with your 23rd birthday!</p>
        <p>I hope you'll have a splendid day. Wishing you a beautiful day full of love and happiness.</p>
        <p>A friend like you is more priceless than the most beautiful diamond. You are not only strong and wise, but kind and thoughtful as well. Your birthday is the perfect opportunity to show you much I care and how grateful I am to have you in my life.</p>
        <p>My wish for you on your birthday is that you are, and will always be, happy and healthy!.</p>
